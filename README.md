# Jenkins Pipeline on AWS Project

In this project I am trying to build a CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins which
accesses the static website page from the Amazon S3 and does HTML linting to
check for any mistakes in the HTML file

Here is the outline of the steps taken in the project-

* AWS Steps
* Install Jenkins On Ubuntu
* Set Up Jenkins
* Install required plugins
* Set up GitHub
* Set up AWS credentials in Jenkins
* Set up S3 Bucket
* Set up pipeline for AWS
* Add another stage in pipeline
